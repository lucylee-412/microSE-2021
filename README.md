# microSE_2-26

Contributors: Lucy Lee, Kelia

Assignment: Take the given Midterm Project files from the first half of the group project, and revamp the site.

We decided to go with an anime theme, and divided the three pages we created among the three members.
- Home page (originally SiestaCon) - Artem
- Anime character facts (originally state facts & postcard generator) - Kelia
- Contact form (originally Helping Hands contact form) - Lucy

## Change Log:
*2/28:*
- Lucy - Added comments to Bio.html, detailing which CSS files were used for each div classes. Redid some of the code for outer-wrapper class and img-holder class to re-stylize font and images in Bio.html.

*2/27:*
- **Lucy** - Debugged code in Bio.html (renamed; originally Postcards.html) to include missing curly braces, and matching variable + function names.

*2/26:*
- **Kelia** - Created a character-data.js script to use as a database for the table generators in Postcards.html.
- **Lucy** - Created a button on Quiz.html (renamed; originally VolunterApp.html) that generates a random image. Currently not working as intended, but will figure something out.
